As many as 3 out of 4 menstruators have experienced some form of premenstrual syndrome. A commonly known side effect is cramping, when the uterus contracts in an effort to help period blood flow out of the vagina. These cramps usually occur during the beginning of your period, or days where you experience heavier flow. Other symptoms include, but are not limited to:

                <h2 class="font-[lemon-bold] underline text-[2rem] pt-5 pb-5">Period Poverty</h2>
                <p>
                    <mark class="bg-transparent font-bold">Period Poverty</mark> is known as <mark class="bg-highlight">a lack of access to products, few water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities, and limited menstrual health education.</mark>  Approximately 500 million females in the U.S. experience period poverty. Period poverty can manifest itself in many ways, such as struggling to afford products or not having accessibility to quality menstrual products. This in turn negatively impacts a menstruators overall menstrual health. 
                </p>
                <p class="pt-5">
                    Period poverty goes hand in hand with accessibility to products. For example, many females in rural Ethiopia do not have access to menstrual products; about 1⁄4 of rural Ethiopian females reported using materials such as paper, tissue, or cloth as alternatives to menstrual products. The same study also found that 10% of girls under 15 years old relying on makeshift menstrual products

                <p class="pt-5">
                    Across the world, affordability also becomes an issue. Menstruators typically spend $20 a month on period products alone, which quickly adds up. Considering that only $10 is given from food stamps toward feminine hygiene products, and many states not recognizing menstrual products as necessary, it can be difficult to afford menstrual products for those who are already in poverty. About 1 in every 5 teens in the US struggle to afford menstrual products. (Thinx, 2019)                </p>

                <h2 class="font-[lemon-bold] underline text-[2rem] pt-5 pb-5">Stigma</h2>
                <p>
                    Especially in patriarchal societies such as India, menstruation is seen as taboo. In relation to menstrual hygiene, the lack of support for such serves to entrench the lower status of women. Many women are excluded from everyday life, such as education and workplace, while menstruating. About 70% of Indian mothers consider menstruation to be “dirty.” This belief leads to silence around the topic, which is harmful to newly menstruating girls. This stigma limits their knowledge of their hygiene and body, leading to a declining physical and mental health. In Bangladesh, only 6% of schools provide menstrual health education and ⅓ of girls report menstrual issues to negatively impact their school performance.

                    <li>Ask questions! Don’t be afraid to seek outside help if you don’t understand a certain part about the menstrual cycle. </li>
                    <li>Educate yourself on general knowledge about menstruation in general. Please visit our resource page if you would like to find great links approved by us! </li>
                    <li>Destigmatize talking about menstruation. If everyone can understand that this is a normal process with nothing to be ashamed of, our school can achieve a better MHM. </li>
                    <li>Donate to a nonprofit organization that works towards improving MHM. For example, nonprofits such as the Period Project and Planned Parenthood directly work with females to get them quality products. </li>
